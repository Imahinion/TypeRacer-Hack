# TypeRacer-Hack
TypeRacer hack which types huge chunks of words with the single press of the space-bar or any letter key on your keyboard. 
I have added different speeds, you can also make your own speeds by either deleting or adding lines of code. All the lines are the same code so you can copy and paste.
Currently working on a way to change the speed within a single repository so you don't have to do it manually.
